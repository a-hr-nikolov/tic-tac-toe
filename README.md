# Tic-Tac-Tie

This game is a challenge project to get used to using IIFEs and factory functions. Later I refactored it to get rid of IIFEs (since they were used for the 'module' pattern) and simply extract that functionality into separate modules/files.

I even implemented a class for creating the player objects, but then decided against it. It can still be seen in the code though.

While the game logic is not necessarily tough to figure out, separating concerns was a bit of a challenge for me. Even now, I know that I am not following the single responsibility principle everywhere.
